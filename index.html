      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Dennis on drums">

      <p>Hello all!  Here is a little bit about myself. I grew up in a small town called Leroy Township in Northeast Ohio. I went to High School at Riverside High in Painesville. Some of my hobbies include beer and wine making,gardening,woodworking,fishing,target shooting and making ammunition. I also have been playing the drums since I was in 5th grade. I can't beleive that was over 20 years ago! About nine years ago some friends and I started a band called Midnight Buford. We write all of our own music and have formed our own genre called 'Junk Rock'. We all enjoy playing together still to this day.</p>

      <p>Some of my work history includes resturant management,assembly and testing work,and medical research. For the last 10 years I worked in research studying Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease at Case Western Reserve University. I have two publicatons. One is in PlosOne Science and the other is in The Journal of Immunology. I am currenty studying coding and web development at Case Western Reserve University. After a decade I feel it is time to learn some new skills and change careers.</p>
